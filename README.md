# Movie-Recommendation-Prediction

# Title of Project:
Movie Success Prediction Using Big Data Analysis


# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the success of a movie based on several factors, such as budget, genre, cast, director, and more. Success can be measured by box office performance or ratings.

# Explanation:
1. Linear Regression: This model provides a basic interpretation of how the features affect the target, but it may not capture non-linear relationships.
2. Random Forest Regressor: This model often performs better for complex datasets due to its ability to capture non-linear patterns and interactions between variables.
3. Feature Importance: Random Forest can provide insights into the most important features influencing the revenue.
